                <strong>Optical and Radio Analysis of Systemically Classified Broad-lined Type Ic Supernovae from the
                    Zwicky Transient Facility </strong><br>
                <em>Srinivasaragavan et al., AAS: ApJ, 2024</em><br>
                We study a magnitude-limited sample of 36 Broad-lined Type Ic Supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) from the Zwicky
                Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey (detected between March 2018 and August 2021), which is the
                largest systematic study of SNe Ic-BL done in literature thus far. We present the light curves (LCs) for
                each of the SNe, and analyze the shape of the LCs to derive empirical parameters, along with the explosion
                epochs for every event. The sample has an average absolute peak magnitude in the r band of Mmaxr =
                -18.51 ± 0.15 mag. Using spectra obtained around peak light, we compute expansion velocities from the
                Fe II 5169 Angstrom line for each event with high enough signal-to-noise ratio spectra, and find an average
                value of vph = 16,100 ± 1,100 km s−1. We also compute bolometric LCs, study the blackbody temperature
                and radii evolution over time, and derive the explosion properties of the SNe. The explosion properties
                of the sample have average values of MNi = 0.37+0.08−0.06 solar masses, Mej = 2.45+0.47−0.41 solar masses,
                and EK= 4.02+1.37−1.00×1051 erg. Thirteen events have radio observations from the Very Large Array, with
                8 detections and 5 non-detections. We find that the populations that have radio detections and radio
                non-detections are indistinct from one another with respect to their optically-inferred explosion
                properties, and there are no statistically significant correlations present between the events' radio
                luminosities and optically-inferred explosion properties. This provides evidence that the explosion
                properties derived from optical data alone cannot give inferences about the radio properties of SNe Ic-BL,
                and likely their relativistic jet formation mechanisms.

            Here is a list of proposals I have worked on, either as a Principal Investigator or as a Co-Author. Each

                <strong>Supernovae with Luminous Radio Counterparts: A Systematic ZTF+VLASS Search: VLA/25A-386 </strong><br>
                <em>Anna Ho, Daniel Perley, Alessandra Corsi, Poonam Chandra, Dillon Dong, Gregg Hallinan, Jack Pope,
                    Marquice Sanchez-Fleming, Jada Vail, Harlan Philips, Jason Sevilla</em><br>
                The Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey is the largest flux-limited survey of extragalactic
                optical transients to date. We performed a cross match between ~10,000 spectroscopically classified BTS
                transients and the VLA Sky Survey, and identified over a dozen supernovae with unusually luminous radio
                counterparts. We request VLA multi-band observations to constrain the energetics and mass-loss histories
                of their progenitor systems. Our VLA multi-band data will be complemented by optical photometry and
                spectroscopy, and lower-frequency data from the uGMRT.

                <strong>On The Electrodynamics of Curved Spacetime</strong><br>
                <em>Marquice Sanchez-Fleming, Apr. 2024</em><br>
                This paper delves into the propagation of electromagnetic waves through curved spacetime around the
                presence of high-mass astronomical-bodies.

                <strong>Gauge Invariance as Applied to Maxwell's Equations</strong><br>
                <em>Marquice Sanchez-Fleming, July 2024</em><br>
                This paper shows that Maxwell's Equations are manifestly covariant, and that they remain so even
                under gauge transformations.

                    We report ZTF observations of a blue rapidly evolving transient, AT2024lhs (ZTF24aascytf). The host
                    galaxy has a Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) redshift of z = 0.038, implying a peak
                    absolute magnitude of M_g = -17.5 mag.

                    We report photometric and spectroscopic observations of a rapidly evolving transient, AT2024kmq
                    (ZTF24aapvieu). A Gemini spectrum shows that the host-galaxy redshift is z = 0.192 and that the
                    galaxy has no active star formation, unlike the hosts of most other rapidly evolving transients
                    discovered to date.

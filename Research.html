    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>
        My work involved the cross-matching of radio data from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) with optical data from
        the Bright Transient Survey (BTS) headed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The cross-matching is done via the
        usage of numerous Python scripts, which do the following, in that general order.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a 'get_cutout' function, once the script is provided with right ascension and declination coordinates,
            it will then search the VLASS catalog for a source at those coordinates across all the epochs. If a radio
            If there is a corresponding tile, it will download that tile and all future iterations of itself, granted they
            exist.
        </li>
        <li>
            After downloading the VLASS tiles, it then begins to download cutouts from both the Legacy Survey and PanStaRRS
            sky surveys, with the 'plot_ls_cutout' and 'plot_ps_cutout' functions, respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using two more functions, 'process_object' and 'process_csv', I am able to run the previously named functions
            across an entire csv, such as <a href="/bts_data.CSV" target="_blank">this one</a>, automating the process of
            downloading the cutouts for the 8,888 objects.
        </li>
        <li>
            After all the images are downloaded and saved to an 'Images' folder, I have another script that generates an
            html webpage that displays the transients, their TNS ID, right ascension and declination, and the cutouts in a
            single row. Furthermore, underneath each VLASS cutout, I have the difference in days from the initial observation
            by ZTF. For example, if it says 'Difference in Days: 163.4210000000021', then that implies that particular epoch
            observed that transient 163.421 days after ZTF observed the object, and naturally, if it says 'Difference in
            Days: -947.6589999999997', then that epoch was imaged 947.658 days before ZTF observed the object. An example
            of a few rows from the html page are pasted below.
            <div class="image">
                <img src="sample_rows.png" alt="Sample Rows">
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            At this point, I developed a script that calculated the statistical significances of the increase in the Peak
            Flux and RMS across the epochs, which I then used to exclude transients who had a statistical significance of
            less than 4, providing me with a list of transients who had clear, and statistically significant radio
            detection.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now that I had a list of transients I was confident with, I submitted a proposal to the Very Large Array for
            additional observing of the transients.
        </li>
        <li>
            All scripts associated with this project are available for public use on my GitHub, found in <a
                href="https://github.com/marquicesanchezfleming/VLASS-ZTF-Crossmatch">this</a> repository.
